# Notification System for Clutch App

## Overview

The goal is to implement a notification system that allows users to subscribe to notifications for specific MLB teams. When new information is retrieved for a subscribed team, users will receive notifications.

## Steps to Implement Notification System

### 1. User Subscription

- **Feature**: Allow users to toggle notifications for specific teams.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create a user interface where users can select their favorite teams.
  - Store user preferences in a database (e.g., using Sequelize with SQLite).

### 2. Subscription Endpoint

- **API Endpoint**: Create a POST endpoint to handle user subscriptions.
- **Example**:
  - Endpoint: `/api/subscribe`
  - Request Body: `{ "userId": "123", "teamId": "456" }`

### 3. Retrieving Latest Team Information

- **Use MLB API**: Utilize the `mlb-api-spec.json` to identify relevant endpoints for retrieving team data.
- **Example**:
  - Endpoint: `/api/v1/teams/{teamId}/schedule`
  - This endpoint can be used to get the latest schedule and updates for a specific team.

### 4. Notification Logic

- **Trigger Notifications**: Implement logic to check for updates for subscribed teams.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a cron job or a similar scheduling mechanism to periodically check for updates.
  - If updates are found, send notifications to all users subscribed to that team.

### 5. Sending Notifications

- **Push Notifications**: Use the web-push library to send notifications to users.
- **Example Payload**:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "New Update for Your Team!",
    "body": "The latest game results for your team are available.",
    "icon": "path/to/icon.png"
  }
  ```

### 6. Frontend Integration

- **Service Worker**: Implement a service worker to handle push notifications in the browser.
- **Example**:
  - Register the service worker in the main JavaScript file.
  - Handle incoming push events to display notifications.

### 7. Testing

- **Test Cases**:
  - Subscribe a user to a team and verify that notifications are received when updates occur.
  - Ensure that users can unsubscribe and that notifications stop.

## Conclusion

Implementing a notification system for the Clutch app will enhance user engagement by providing timely updates on their favorite teams. By following the outlined steps, we can create a robust MVP that stands out in the competition.
