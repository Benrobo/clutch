   - Parallel processing where possible
   - Smart queuing system
   - Resource management

2. Content Delivery
   - CDN integration
   - Edge caching
   - Progressive loading

### Scalability

1. Processing Pipeline

   - Horizontal scaling
   - Load balancing
   - Queue management

2. Storage
   - Content distribution
   - Database sharding
   - Cache strategies

### Quality Control

1. Content Verification

   - Clip quality checks
   - Metadata validation
   - User feedback loop

2. AI Accuracy
   - Confidence thresholds
   - Manual review triggers
   - Continuous learning

### Basic Game Terms

- **Inning**: Game period (9 innings in a game)
- **Top/Bottom**: First/second half of an inning
- **Out**: When a batter or runner is eliminated (3 outs end an inning)
- **Run**: A point scored
- **Score**: Format is "Team A - Team B" (e.g., "5-3")

### Offensive Terms

- **Hit**: Successfully striking the ball
- **Single**: Reaching first base on a hit
- **Double**: Reaching second base on a hit
- **Triple**: Reaching third base on a hit
- **Home Run**: Hitting the ball out of play, scoring a run
- **RBI (Run Batted In)**: When a batter's action leads to a run

### Defensive Terms

- **Strike**: Missed/invalid hit attempt (3 strikes = out)
- **Ball**: Pitch outside strike zone (4 balls = walk)
- **Strikeout**: When a batter gets 3 strikes
- **Catch**: Fielder catches hit ball before it touches ground
- **Double Play**: Two outs in one play

### Field Positions

- **Pitcher**: Player who throws the ball
- **Batter**: Player hitting the ball
- **Catcher**: Player behind home plate
- **Infield**: Area with bases
- **Outfield**: Area beyond bases

### Common Plays

- **Base Hit**: Ball hit into play allowing runner to reach base
- **Fly Ball**: Ball hit high in the air
- **Ground Ball**: Ball hit on the ground
- **Base Running**: Movement between bases
- **Steal**: Runner advances during pitch

### Game Situations

- **Bases Loaded**: Runners on all bases
- **Full Count**: 3 balls, 2 strikes
- **Walk-Off**: Winning play in final inning
- **Save**: Preserving a close lead to win

This terminology will help Gemini identify and describe key moments in game footage.

- get live game

## Video Processing Evolution: Issues & Solutions

- **Version 1**: Grid layout was too rigid and Gemini kept hallucinating on frame text detection - not reliable at all ü§ñ

- **Version 2:** Text overlays still unreadable and grid system keeps breaking with different video lengths üìè

- **Version 3:** Scene transitions are a mess and there's no way to identify if a moment is actually important üé¨

- **Version 4:** Scene detection is completely random and transitions look like they're from Windows Movie Maker 2000 üòÖ

- **Version 5:** Clips are overlapping everywhere and scenes keep getting duplicated - this isn't working üîÑ

- **Version 6:** Scene detection improved but it's slower than a snail and still can't understand what's happening in the video üêå

- **Version 7:** Switched to audio analysis but keyword detection is missing half the important plays - not good enough for sports üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- **Version 8 (Final):** Combined audio and visual with baseball keywords - still has overlap issues but at least it catches the important moments now üéØ

- **Version 9 (Latest):** Completely new approach focusing on transcript-first, using subtitles as source of truth, and LLM for context analysis - no more scene detection headaches! üéâ
