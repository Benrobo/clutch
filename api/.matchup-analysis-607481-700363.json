    "insight": "Okay, so Bummer's ERA is 3.58 and he has 4 wins which is not bad, but recently he has been giving up more runs. Smith-Shawver has a 0.00 ERA, itâ€™s just that he has no wins, and is trending upward. If we are thinking shutouts, AJ has a better shot right now given his recent performances, making him a bit more likely than Bummer."
