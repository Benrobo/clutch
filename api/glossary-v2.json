And when the ball is dead, no runner may return to touch a missed base after he has touched a base beyond the missed base. That means a batter who hits a ground-rule double or a homer can be called out on appeal if he misses first base and doesn't correct his error before touching second.\nAppeals must be made before the next pitch or attempted play, or before the entire defensive team has left fair territory if the play in question resulted in the end of a half-inning.

It can be used to evaluate outfielders on attempted assists, catchers on stolen base and pickoff throws, and infielders on throws across the diamond. Fielders -- especially outfielders -- often get a running start before throwing. As a result, the velocity on their throws can exceed that of pitchers, who throw to batters from the mound.\nPutting a quantifiable number on the strength of a fielder's arm helps to evaluate the effectiveness of that arm. However, arm strength is not the only component of a good throw. Along with velocity, the accuracy of the throw is very important, as is the trajectory. A 90 mph throw from the outfield that bounces three times will inevitably lose speed each time it hits the ground.\nAdditionally, Statcast provides an Arm Strength leaderboard on Baseball Savant, displaying the fielders with the highest average arm strength on \"max-effort\" throws. \nThe Arm Strength leaderboard includes rankings for both outfielders and infielders, going back to the first season of Hawk-Eye tracking data in 2020. Because each position requires different amounts and types of throws, a player's average max-effort arm strength is determined differently for each position, with varying numbers of throws required to qualify for the leaderboard.\nHere is how the Arm Strength metric is calculated for each position:"

During the 2016 regular season, balls assigned the Barreled classification had a batting average of .822 and a 2.386 slugging percentage.\nTo be Barreled, a batted ball requires an exit velocity of at least 98 mph.

For every mph over 98, the range of launch angles expands.\nFor example: A ball traveling 99 mph always earns 'Barreled' status when struck between 25-31 degrees. Add one more mph -- to reach 100 -- and the range grows another three degrees, to 24-33.\nEvery additional mph over 100 increases the range another two to three degrees until an exit velocity of 116 mph is reached.

With that information available for each play, the player’s actual success rate can be compared to the estimated rate and the cumulative metric can be created. Importantly, it does account both for bases taken (prevented, for outfielders) and chances taken or not. In that way, credit can be given to outfielders who do not get a chance to make an assist because their reputation for quality throwing precedes them.\nThis does account for extra bases taken by batters or runners on batted balls; it does not include stolen bases, as it’s about taking extra bases against fielders.\nA good example can be seen here, when Ronald Acuña Jr. threw out Alec Burleson attempting to stretch a single into a double. Based on factors including the location of the ball, the distance from second base, and knowledge of the speed and location of the runner, this was a chance where Acuña was given just a 5% estimated likelihood of throwing the runner out. That he successfully did so gave him +0.95 runs to his seasonal total.\nThe top of the 2022 seasonal leaderboard offers a good example of how different skills can lead into the seasonal total.\nMichael A. Taylor led at +6 runs, ahead of several tied at +5. Taylor’s +5 came via: +4 runs on throwing runners out, +6 runs on holds (having runners not attempt to advance), and -5 on advances (allowing runners to advance).

    "url": "/glossary/rules/batters-box",
    "definition": "A regulation baseball field has two batter's boxes -- one on the left side and one on the right side of home plate -- drawn using the same chalk as the baselines. From the pitcher's point of view, left-handed batters stand in the batter's box on the left side of the plate and right-handed batters stand in the batter's box on the right side of the plate.\nThe batter is expected to promptly take his place in the batter's box when his turn to bat comes up and is not permitted to exit the box once the pitcher begins his windup or comes to the set position. The batter can request to be granted time by the umpire if the pitcher has not begun his windup or come to the set position. If his request is granted, the batter is then able to exit the box -- but not the dirt area surrounding home plate. He may also exit the box in other select instances, such as after a swing or bunt attempt, a passed ball, a wild pitch or an inside pitch that forces him out of the box. Furthermore, he may exit the box if the pitcher or catcher vacates his respective position, a member of the defensive team requests time or attempts a play on a runner at any base, or an attempted check swing is appealed to a base umpire. Otherwise, the batter is expected to keep at least one foot inside the box throughout his time at bat.\nIf a batted ball that has not yet been touched by a fielder makes contact with a batter who still has two feet in the batter's box, the ball will be ruled foul. But if the batter has already exited the batter's box before being contacted by a fair ball that has not yet been touched by a fielder, the batter will be called out."

    "definition": "Batters faced is simply a count of the number of total plate appearances against a certain pitcher or team. In a perfect game -- with 27 outs -- a pitcher will record 27 batters faced.\nBatters faced can often be used as a reference for in-game strategy. A hurler has gone through the opposing lineup once after facing nine batters. After recording 18 batters faced, he becomes poised to take on the opposing lineup a third time. Not surprisingly, pitchers with high batters faced totals are also the ones who throw the most innings.\nBatters faced can be determined by counting the total number of plate appearances -- or by adding runs, runners left on base and total outs."

    "url": "/glossary/standard-stats/batting-average",
    "definition": "One of the oldest and most universal tools to measure a hitter's success at the plate, batting average is determined by dividing a player's hits by his total at-bats for a number between zero (shown as .000) and one (1.000). In recent years, the league-wide batting average has typically hovered around .250.\nWhile batting average is a useful tool for measuring a player's ability at the plate, it isn't all-encompassing. For instance, batting average doesn't take into account the number of times a batter reaches base via walks or hit-by-pitches. And it doesn't take into account hit type (with a double, triple or home run being more valuable than a single).\nBatting average can also be applied in evaluating pitchers. In this case, it is called either \"opponents' batting average\" or \"batting average against,\" and it is determined by dividing the number of hits against a given pitcher by the number of at-bats against him.\nBAA is very common in evaluating pitchers -- especially when assessing opponent handed-ness splits. A pitcher cannot have an ERA against left-handed hitters because they are interspersed with righties in lineups. So when a pitcher's ability against hitters from each side of the plate is being compared, it is usually done by using either BAA or OPS-against."

Furthermore, any score or advancement caused by the incorrect batter batting a ball or reaching first base is nullified.\nHowever, scores or advancements are counted if they occur as a result of a stolen base, balk, wild pitch or passed ball during the incorrect batter's plate appearance.\nAppeal made following plate appearance and after next pitch or attempted play\nIf no appeal is made before the next pitch or attempted play following the conclusion of the incorrect batter's plate appearance, the incorrect batter is now considered to have batted in turn and all scores or advancements made during or as a result of his plate appearance are counted.

(To best understand, please review the definition for a squared up ball, or the efficiency of a batter’s contact first.)\nWhile a squared-up swing expresses the relationship between how much exit velocity is possible given the speed of that swing+pitch and how much exit velocity was actually realized, it does not strictly have a bat speed minimum requirement. A blast, then, is a more valuable and rarer kind of swing, taking only the most valuable combinations of hard swings and contact efficiency.\nDue to the combination of squared-up rate and swing speed, the qualifications for a blast are on a rolling scale based on the interaction of one metric with the other. The strict definition is percent squared up*100 + bat speed >= 164, but an easier shorthand way to consider it is that the average between squared-up rate and bat speed has to be at least 82 in order to be a blast."

If a reliever enters with a man already on third base, and he allows that runner to score the tying run, he is charged with a blown save.\nAlthough many blown saves occur in the ninth inning or later, they aren't limited to the ninth inning. If a pitcher enters in the eighth inning and surrenders the tying run in a save situation, he is given a blown save -- regardless of whether he pitches the ninth. A pitcher can still receive either a win or a loss (or a no-decision) after recording a blown save, depending on the ensuing results.\nBlown saves are used as a tool to evaluate the effectiveness of a closer. However, not all blown saves are created equal -- after all, entering with a three-run lead in the ninth and entering with a one-run lead and a man on third in the eighth are both considered save situations. It's important to remember this when assessing closers based on their blown saves."

    "definition": "Catch Probability represents the likelihood that a batted ball to the outfield will be caught, based on four important pieces of information tracked by Statcast. 1. How far did the fielder have to go? 2. How much time did he have to get there. 3. What direction did he need to go in? 4. Was proximity to the wall a factor?\nAccordingly, each tracked batted ball to the outfield is assigned an expected Catch Probability percentage -- relative to comparable catch opportunities in the Statcast era -- based on distance needed and opportunity time. The more time a fielder has to react to a ball and the less distance needed to reach it, the higher the Catch Probability.\nDistance needed is used instead of distance covered, which measures the ground a fielder covers from the point the ball is struck to the time the play is made, to prevent fielders from receiving additional credit for taking longer-than-necessary routes to the ball. Meanwhile, opportunity time is calculated from the point the ball leaves the pitcher's hand (rather than when the batter makes contact) to credit instances in which a fielder adjusts his position based on where the catcher sets up or what type of pitch is called.\nAs of May 2017: Catch Probability began to account for fielding direction, with plays compelling an outfielder to travel in the opposite direction of home plate (colloquially described as \"going back on the ball\") receiving an adjustment to account for their relative degree of difficulty.\nFor the purpose of determining what counts as \"going back on the ball,\" the 360 degree range around each fielder is cut into six 60 degree sections (0 degrees is always toward home plate, while 180 degrees is always straight back). The zone defined as \"going back\" is 30 degrees to the left and right of the 180 degree line.\nAs of 2018, Catch Probability now accounts for the extra difficulty of plays made at or near the wall. Read more about how wall balls work here.\nAs of 2019, Catch Probability plays are now reported in five percent bands, so 5 percent, 10 percent, 15 percent, etc. There's no functional difference in a 21 percent play vs. a 22 percent one, for example, and it implied accuracy that probably isn't there, so the best plays will now all be 5 percent plays."

The effects of a single pitch can be huge; in 2019, hitters had an .858 OPS after a 1-0 count, but just a .631 OPS after an 0-1 count.\nStatcast's catcher framing numbers are primarily based on the edges of the plate (or the \"Shadow Zone\" in this image), the area that is the width of two baseballs (one inside the zone, one outside) all around the edges of the strike zone. Statcast's catcher framing is adjusted both for park and the pitcher. Read more about catcher framing.\nThe numbers on the leaderboard are expressed in several different ways:\n• Strike rate: Percentage of non-swings on the edges of the zone converted into called strikes. In 2019, Austin Hedges led with 54.1%, and Isiah Kiner-Falefa was at the bottom with 42.3%. The MLB average was 48.1%.• Runs from Extra Strikes: Converts strikes to runs saved on a .125 run/strike basis.

This typically happens after a pitch, when a catcher throws the ball to the fielder at the base before the runner reaches it. But it can also happen before a pitch, typically when a pitcher throws the ball to first base for a pickoff attempt but the batter has already left for second.\nMany different factors go into a caught stealing. Namely: a pitcher's quick release to home plate, a catcher's quick transfer and throw, a good tag by the fielder receiving the ball and a poor jump -- or slow first step -- by the baserunner.\nIf a runner is thrown out trying to advance on a wild pitch or a passed ball, this does not count as a caught stealing. Similarly, a runner who is picked off while diving back to a base has not been \"caught stealing\" because he never attempted to steal in the first place. If a batter steals a base safely but is tagged when he comes off the base before fully gaining his balance, it still counts as a caught stealing, because he was never established on the base.\nBaseball's caught-stealing leaders are typically some of the fastest players in the game, as such players attempt to steal the most bases.\nWhen a catcher gets an assist on a caught stealing, he is awarded a catcher caught stealing (CCS). He is also awarded a CCS if the recipient drops his throw for an error and the official scorer judges that the runner would have been out had the ball been caught. However, when a runner is thrown out trying to advance on a wild pitch or a passed ball, a catcher caught stealing is not awarded."

(A larger number of relief pitchers do not, because they typically only face hitters once and therefore have less of a need for deception.) A good changeup will cause a hitter to start his swing well before the pitch arrives, resulting in either a swing and miss or very weak contact. But when a hitter is able to identify the changeup, the pitch is among the easiest to hit because of its low velocity.\nA changeup is often said to \"fade\" or \"fall off the table,\" because it looks like a fastball out of the pitcher's hand, only to drop down under the hitter's bat while also breaking horizontally toward the pitcher's arm side."

If the two sides cannot come to terms on a salary or multi-year deal, an arbitration hearing will be held and a panel of arbitrators will determine his salary. The offseason deadline for clubs to tender contracts to eligible players typically falls in early December."

    "url": "/glossary/pitch-types/curveball",
    "definition": "A curveball is a breaking pitch that has more movement than just about any other pitch. It is thrown slower and with more overall break than a slider, and it is used to keep hitters off-balance. When executed correctly by a pitcher, a batter expecting a fastball will swing too early and over the top of the curveball.\nMost professional pitchers possess either a curveball or a slider -- and some possess both breaking pitches. Having a breaking pitch, like a curveball, is an essential component to a professional starter's arsenal, because it keeps the hitter off-balance and unable to commit to gearing up exclusively for a fastball.\nThe curveball has been one of the most commonly used pitches throughout baseball history, and the universally accepted signal for a curveball is a catcher putting down two fingers.\nThe pitch is so well known in American culture that the phrase \"throw a curveball\" has emerged as an idiom. Like the goal of pitchers when throwing the pitch, the idiom \"to throw a curve\" means to trick someone with something unexpected."

    "definition": "A cutter is a version of the fastball, designed to move slightly toward the pitcher's glove side as it reaches home plate -- a cutter from a right-handed pitcher will \"cut\" away from a right-handed hitter, or in toward a left-handed hitter. Cutters are not thrown by as many Major League pitchers as four-seam fastballs or sinkers, but for some of the pitchers who possess a cutter, it is one of their primary pitches. \nAlthough cutters are a form of fastball, a pitcher will often throw a cutter in addition to his four-seam fastball or sinker, with the cutter having a slightly lower velocity. For some pitchers, their cutter is more like a breaking ball -- almost a hard slider -- than a fastball. \nA pitcher with an effective cutter can break many bats. When thrown from a right-handed pitcher to a left-handed hitter, or a lefty pitcher to a righty hitter, a cutter will quickly move in toward a hitter's hands. If the hitter swings, he often hits the ball on the smaller part -- or handle -- of the bat, causing it to break.\nIn rare cases, switch-hitters have been known to bat from the same side as the pitcher's throwing arm when that pitcher throws primarily cutters. (Typically, a switch-hitter will hit from the opposite side of a pitcher's throwing arm.) This is because the unique movement on the cutter causes hitters to get jammed when facing a pitcher of the opposite handedness."

The ruling of a dead ball halts the game and no plays can legally occur until the umpire resumes the game, though baserunners can advance as the result of acts that occurred while the ball was live. Dead balls are frequent occurrences during a game, and the dead-ball period typically does not last long before the ball is put back into play.\nDead balls most frequently occur when a batted ball becomes a foul ball or a fair ball is hit out of the playing field. Other common instances in which the ball is ruled dead include a batter being hit by a pitch, a balk, an illegal collision at home plate, obstruction of a baserunner, interference with a fielder's right of way, spectator interference, a batter or runner being granted time out by the umpire and a fair batted ball striking an umpire or runner.\nIf a fair ball gets lodged in the outfield wall padding -- or the ivy, in the case of Wrigley Field -- it is a ground-rule double. On all ground-rule doubles, the ball is dead, the batter-runner goes to second and all additional runners are permitted to move up two bases from the one they occupied at the time of the pitch."

Because the pitcher is still part of the team's nine defensive players, the designated hitter -- or \"DH\" -- does not take the field on defense.\nThe rule was adopted by the American League in 1973, while pitchers continued to hit in games played at National League parks. The designated hitter was adopted by the National League as part of the 2022-26 collective bargaining agreement.\nThe DH must be selected prior to the game, and that selected hitter must come to bat at least one time -- unless the opposing team changes pitchers prior to that point. A team that chooses not to select a DH prior to a game is barred from using a DH for the rest of that game. A player who enters the game in place of the DH -- either as a pinch-hitter or a pinch-runner -- becomes the DH in his team's lineup thereafter.\nIf a player serving as the DH is later used on defense, he continues to bat in his same lineup spot. But for the rest of the game, his team cannot use a DH to bat in place of the pitcher. A team is also barred from using a DH for the rest of the game if the pitcher moves from the mound to another defensive position, a player pinch-hits for any other player and then becomes the pitcher, or the current pitcher pinch-hits or pinch-runs for the DH.\nThe DH rule was amended prior to the 2022 season to afford additional flexibility to starting pitchers who bat for themselves. Such a player is considered two separate people for the purposes of the DH rule. If the player is replaced as the pitcher, he can continue as the DH, and if the DH is replaced, he can continue as the pitcher (but can no longer bat for himself)."

It was kept in place in 2021 and 2022, and the Joint Competition Committee voted to make it a permanent addition to the rulebook prior to the 2023 season."

In this case, the defense typically throws the ball to second base to get the first out before throwing the ball to first base for the second out.\nA double play can be recorded on a flyout if a fielder throws out a runner who strayed off his base or was trying to advance. Double plays also don't necessarily need to feature a force out at second. If the defense gets the out at first base, then tags another runner out on the bases, that counts as a double play as well.\nPitchers who record the highest number of double plays typically induce a high frequency of ground balls.

ERA is the most commonly accepted statistical tool for evaluating pitchers.\nThe formula for finding ERA is: 9 x earned runs / innings pitched. If a pitcher exits a game with runners on base, any earned runs scored by those runners will count against him.\nERA should be an ideal evaluation of pitchers. The goal of pitching is to prevent runs from scoring, and ERA tells us basically how well a pitcher does that. How many runs does he allow, on average, that are his fault in a given game?\nBut there are a few flaws with ERA, because so many different factors can affect it. While defensive mistakes are taken into account, great defensive plays are not. So a pitcher with an average defense is at a disadvantage to a pitcher with a great defense. It's also hard to evaluate ERA across the two leagues in Major League Baseball, because the absence of a designated hitter in the National League tends to keep pitchers' ERAs lower. Even the ballpark in which a pitcher pitches can affect a pitcher's ERA because certain stadiums are more conducive to run scoring.\nStill, ERA is a useful tool for measuring a starting pitcher's success. However, it's not quite as effective in measuring relief pitchers, who often pitch only fractions of an inning -- sometimes leaving their ERA in the hands of other relievers. Even relief pitchers who pitch a full inning tend to exert all their energy on those three outs, instead of spreading it out over the course of a game. This means relievers generally have lower ERAs than starting pitchers."

A batter does not necessarily need to reach base for a fielder to be given an error. If he drops a foul ball that extends an at-bat, that fielder can also be assessed an error.\nDefensive errors are a factor in some statistical equations. For instance, batters do not receive RBIs for any runs that would not have scored without the help of an error. And pitchers are not assessed any earned runs for runs that would not have scored without the error.\nThe league leaders in errors are typically shortstops and third basemen, who have to deal with a wide array of tricky ground balls and tough throws across the diamond. There is no classification of errors either. So a shortstop who makes a nice play on a ball but throws it away, allowing the batter to advance to second, is given an error, much in the same way an outfielder would be if he dropped an easy fly ball."

(As of January 2019, xBA now factors in a batter's seasonal Sprint Speed on \"topped\" or weakly hit\" balls).\nFor example, a line drive to the outfield with an xBA of .700 is given that figure because balls with a similar exit velocity and launch angle have become hits seven out of 10 times.\nKnowing the expected outcomes of each individual batted ball from a particular player over the course of a season allows for the formation of said player's Expected Batting Average on balls in play. Real-world strikeout totals are then added in, resulting in a player's seasonal Expected Batting Average based on the quality of contact, instead of the actual outcomes. Likewise, this exercise can be done for pitchers to get their Expected Batting Average against.\nHit Probability\nExpected Batting Average is derived from Hit Probability, a depreciated metric that was used in 2017-18 and also measured the likelihood that a batted ball would become a hit.

The formula is simple: the total number of putouts and assists by a defender, divided by the total number of chances (putouts, assists and errors).\nThe league's lowest fielding percentages typically come from shortstops and third basemen, who must deal with a wide array of tricky ground balls and tough throws across the diamond. Conversely, catchers, first basemen and outfielders often have the highest fielding percentages because of the ease of the plays they have to make."

Each ball that is hit into the field of play is characterized as a line drive, a fly ball, a ground ball or a pop-up. (A fly ball is a fly to the outfield, while a pop-up is hit to the infield.)\nFly-ball rate can be used as a metric to evaluate both hitters and pitchers, although it's more frequently used to evaluate pitchers.\nWith pitchers, fly-ball rate can be very telling. For one thing, it tells us what type of pitcher we have. Pitchers with high fly-ball rates have a tendency to allow home runs (which result exclusively from fly balls and line drives). In this regard, pitchers generally strive to avoid high fly-ball rates. But some pitchers can thrive with a high fly-ball rate as long as they limit their home runs, because outs occur more frequently on fly balls than on ground balls."

It is often used to overpower hitters, with the goal being for the pitch to get to the strike zone faster than the hitter can handle, thus creating a swing and miss or weak contact because of a late swing. The pitch derives its name because upon being released, four seams come into view on the ball with each rotation.\nA four-seam fastball with high spin is often described as a \"rising fastball,\" because it resists gravity slightly longer, making it look to the hitter like it's rising. Those fastballs will often produce swings and misses, especially when thrown at the top of the strike zone.\nThe fastest four-seamers can come in at over 100 mph, while the Major League average four-seam fastball now sits at about 94 mph."

Introduced by Bill James in the 1980s and updated by fellow sabermetrician Tom Tango in 2014, Game Score is presented as a figure between 0-100 -- except for extreme outliers -- and usually falls between 40-70.\nA Game Score of 50 is considered \"average,\" while a Game Score of 40 is deemed to be \"replacement level.\" Game Scores in the 80s and 90s are widely regarded as impressive, and scores of at least 100 are exceptionally rare. Using Tango's formula, which is the version displayed on MLB.com, only nine of the 4,858 games started in 2015 resulted in Game Scores of 100-plus.\nA Game Score is derived by factoring the quality (based on runs, hits, HR, walks, strikeouts) and quantity (innings) of a starting pitcher's performance\nAlthough James' and Tango's Game Score formulas lie in great parallel, they also diverge in ways that cause Tango's version to be slightly more linked to a pitcher's talent level. In the updated version, the following changes were made:\n• A baseline score was moved from 50 to 40. This change prevents very short outings from being calculated as near average. (Ex. With a 50-score baseline, a starting pitcher could strike out the first batter of the game and be removed to record a Game Score of 52 -- above average. In reality, though, the starting pitcher being lifted after one out puts the team in a highly unfavorable position.\n• A penalty for home runs allowed was implemented. Home runs allowed was not part of the initial formula -- created using the official line score in a box score -- despite their significant impact on a team's chances of victory.\n• The penalty for a walk allowed was doubled from -1 to -2, to be in line with the penalty for a non-homer hit (single, double, triple). Although a non-homer hit is more impactful than a walk, both events are viewed equally when determining a player's talent level."

However, closers aren't the only pitchers to record high totals of games finished.

The opener generally gives way to a reliever in the second or third inning. The prevailing wisdom behind an opener is that it's better for a quality reliever to face the top of the order early in a game than a team's fourth-best or fifth-best starting option. It can also be beneficial to have a right-handed opener face an all-right-handed top of the order or a left-handed opener face multiple imposing lefties.

They often stem from pitchers trying to throw the ball inside but missing by a few inches. Pitchers will often throw inside to make the hitter wary, so they do not crowd the plate. However, a pitcher may sometimes throw at a hitter intentionally as a form of retaliation. If the home-plate umpire suspects this is the case, he has the right to eject the pitcher (and the manager of the pitching team) from the game.\nA hit-by-pitch does not count as a hit, but it does count as a time on base for on-base percentage purposes. Certain hitters -- specifically those who stand very close to the plate -- have a knack for earning HBPs, which can obviously be helpful because the goal of any hitter is to reach base. But hit-by-pitches can also result in injury because most pitches are thrown 80 mph or faster. Per the rules, a batter must make an attempt to avoid being hit by a pitch in order to receive first base.\nPitchers with high HBP totals typically struggle with their control and will also walk a higher-than-normal number of hitters."

(This also occurs when the ball hits the foul pole in left or right field, or when the ball hits an opposing defender on the fly and bounces directly over the wall in fair ground.)\nThere are also instances of \"inside-the-park home runs.\" These occur when the batter hits the ball in play (not over the wall) and touches all four bases without being thrown out. These are extremely rare and typically only occur with a very fast runner at the plate and some sort of misplay by an outfielder that doesn't qualify as an error.\nHome runs can be a great stat for evaluating a hitter's power. They're also good for measuring the success of pitchers, who strive to limit home runs. But home run totals can be affected by the ballpark in which a game is being played.

The statistic is determined by dividing a pitcher's home runs allowed by his total innings pitched and multiplying the result by nine.\nHR/9 is a statistic that -- relatively speaking -- is in the control of the pitcher, because defensive positioning plays no factor. Certain pitchers can have success with a high HR/9 rate, as long as they manage to limit their baserunners otherwise -- leading to fewer multi-run home runs. Pitchers with high fly-ball rates are more likely than ground-ball pitchers to have high HR/9 rates. However, some pitchers have mastered the art of allowing fly balls but not many home runs."

Statcast has the ability to filter Home to First readings, which can be useful when attempting to discern a hitter's ability to \"beat out\" a ground ball hit to an infielder. In some scouting circles, a hitter's Home to First time on infield ground balls is sometimes referred to as \"dig speed.\"\nPlayers with the fastest times generally tally the most infield hits. Said players also tend to force defenses into committing errors, as fielders must rush to retire the speedy runner at first base.\nAs left-handed hitters stand closer to first than right-handed hitters, they are generally represented well on Home to First leaderboards."

Major League Baseball's Basic Agreement prohibits incentives from being awarded based on statistical achievement. Thus, playing time is the near-universal means by which players receive incentives. Pitchers with incentive-laden contracts typically trigger the incentives based on number of innings pitched, number of games started, number of relief appearances, number of games finished, etc. Hitters will most commonly trigger incentives based on plate appearances. Some contracts also contain roster bonuses, which reward a player simply for staying on the active roster for a certain number of days.\nIn the 2011 wave of collective bargaining agreement negotiations, milestone bonuses were prohibited by the league, meaning that players can no longer receive contractual bonuses for reaching plateaus such as their 3,000th hit, 500th home run, 200th win, etc."

The rule is in place to protect against a team allowing a shallow fly ball to drop in with the intention of causing a force play at second and third or second, third and home. Otherwise, the team would be able to force out baserunners who had stayed put on a routine fly ball.\nIn these situations, the umpire will declare \"infield fly\" for the benefit of the baserunners as soon as it is apparent that the fly ball qualifies as an infield fly. The batter is out even if the ball is not caught, and the baserunners can advance at their own risk. If the ball is caught, the baserunners can attempt to advance as they would on a typical ball caught in the air."

They can be used to put a runner on first base, setting up a potential double play.\nIntentional walks occur most frequently with an excellent hitter at the plate and a significantly worse hitter -- or a more favorable matchup for the pitcher -- on deck. Generally, intentional walks occur with no one on first base, but they can also occur -- very, very rarely -- with first base occupied.\nBeginning in the 2017 season, teams no longer need to throw four balls in order to intentionally walk a batter.

They are most often injured during a sudden contraction when they are in a stretched position, such as during a throw or swing.

Each club will have at least a $4.75 million bonus pool to spend, with those that have a pick in Competitive Balance Round A receiving $5.25 million and those with a pick in Competitive Balance Round B receiving $5.75 million.\nClubs will be able to acquire up to 75 percent of their initial international bonus pool money in the 2017-18 and 2018-19 signing periods and up to 60 percent of their initial pools in subsequent signing periods. This means that a club with an initial pool of $5.75 million can increase its pool total via trade to approximately $10.1 million during the 2017-18 and 2018-19 signing periods. The 2017-21 CBA also allows international funds to be traded more freely, as teams must now simply trade international money in increments of $250,000, unless they have less than $250,000 remaining in their pool. Under the 2012-16 CBA, teams were assigned four tradeable \"slots\" with different values designated for each slot. The money was able to be traded only in those increments.\nBeginning in the 2017-18 offseason, any team that is over the luxury tax threshold and signs a Major League free agent that has rejected a qualifying offer will lose $1 million from their international signing pool in the following signing period. A team that is not over the luxury tax would only forfeit $500,000 of its signing pool in the subsequent period.\nThe 2021-22 signing period continues through Dec. 15, 2022, and the 2022-23 signing period will run from Jan. 15, 2023 to Dec. 15, 2023.\nMLB and the MLB Players Association did not agree by July 25, 2022, to implement an International Draft, which means that the international signing periods of the 2022-26 CBA run between Jan. 15 and Dec. 15 with the same parameters established in the 2017-21 CBA.\nUnder the 2017-21 CBA, international amateurs are defined as follows:\n• Players who are determined to be international must be at least 16 or will turn 16 years of age prior to Sept. 1 of the current signing period.\nAny player meeting that criteria becomes eligible to sign a Minor League contract with a Major League organization for a signing bonus that fits within said team's allotted pool. Players that sign for a total bonus of $10,000 or less do not count against a team's allotted bonus pool.\nForeign professionals -- defined as players who are at least 25 years of age and have played as a professional in a foreign league recognized by Major League Baseball for a minimum of six seasons -- maintain exemption from the international bonus pool.\nHistory of the rules\nUnder the terms of the 2012-16 Collective Bargaining Agreement, international pool money was scaled based on the previous season's standings. Clubs were also able to exceed their international bonus pool, but they had to pay a luxury tax for doing so.\nIn addition, clubs that exceeded their pool by five to 10 percent were banned from signing a player for more than a $500,000 bonus the following signing period. For clubs that exceeded their pool by 10 to 15 percent, the maximum bonus they were able to offer dropped to $300,000 during the next signing period. Finally, clubs that exceeded their pool by more than 15 percent were not allowed to sign a player for more than $300,000 during the next two signing periods.\nInternational bonus money was also tradeable under the 2012-16 Collective Bargaining Agreement, but each club's bonus pool was divided into four \"slots.\" For instance, a club with a $3 million pool might have had a $1.5 million slot, an $800,000 slot, a $400,000 slot and a $300,000 slot. The money was able to be traded only in those increments. Moreover, clubs were able to acquire no more than 50 percent of their original pool size.\nClubs that accrued penalties for exceeding their international bonus pool money under the stipulations of the 2012-16 Collective Bargaining Agreement did not have those penalties wiped out by the 2017-21 CBA.\nAlso of note: Previously, foreign-born players were granted exemption from the amateur-bonus-pool rules if they were at least 23 years of age with at least five seasons in a professional league recognized by Major League Baseball.\nBefore 2020, each year's international signing period began on July 2 and continued through June 15 of the following year."

If no agreement is reached in that timeframe, the player returns to his NPB club for the coming season. He cannot be posted again until the following offseason.\nPreviously, Japanese clubs set a release fee that could be as high as $20 million. Any MLB club that was willing to meet the designated release fee could negotiate with the player for 30 days after the player was posted, but only the club with which the player signed had to pay that release fee. Now, the release fee is determined as follows:\n• For Major League contracts with a total guaranteed value of $25 million or less, the release fee will be 20 percent of the total guaranteed value of the contract.• For Major League contracts with a total guaranteed value between $25,000,001 and $50 million, the release fee will be 20 percent of the first $25 million plus 17.5 percent of the total guaranteed value exceeding $25 million.• For Major League contracts with a total guaranteed value of $50,000,001 or more, the release fee will be 20 percent of the first $25 million plus 17.5 percent of next $25 million plus 15 percent of the total guaranteed value exceeding $50 million.• For all Minor League contracts, the release fee will be 25 percent of the signing bonus. For Minor League contracts that contain Major League terms, a supplemental fee will be owed if the player is added to the 25-man roster.• If a posted player signs a Major League contract that contains bonuses, salary escalators or options, a Japanese team may receive a supplemental fee equal to 15 percent of any bonus or salary escalators actually earned by the player, and/or 15 percent of any option that is exercised.\nSo if a player signs a Major League contract with a guaranteed value of $100 million, his Japanese team would receive roughly $16.9 million ($5 million for the first $25 million, $4.4 million for the second $25 million and $7.5 million for the final $50 million).\nThe caveat of the posting system is that foreign-born players are subject to international bonus pool money restrictions unless they are at least 25 years of age and have played as a professional in a foreign league recognized by Major League Baseball for a minimum of six seasons. Under the 2017-21 Collective Bargaining Agreement, each Major League club has a cap between $4.75 million and $5.75 million to spend on the non-exempt foreign-born player pool. Clubs will be able to acquire up to 75 percent of their initial international bonus pool money in the 2017-18 and 2018-19 signing periods and up to 60 percent of their initial pools in subsequent signing periods. This means that a club with an initial pool of $5.75 million can increase its pool total via trade to approximately $10.1 million during the 2017-18 and 2018-19 signing periods."

    "definition": "JAWS (Jaffe Wins Above Replacement Score) is a system created by Jay Jaffe that evaluates a player's worthiness for enshrinement in the National Baseball Hall of Fame by comparing him to the Hall of Famers at his position. The stated goal of JAWS is to maintain or improve the Hall of Fame's standards by electing players who are at least as good as the average Hall of Famer at those players' positions.\nA player's JAWS is calculated by averaging his career WAR with the total WAR from his seven-year peak -- that is, his seven most valuable seasons (consecutive or non-consecutive). This formula allows great players who lack longevity to be judged more favorably than they would by traditional methods.\nFor non-pitchers, any WAR accumulated at the plate, in the field and on the bases is included, while WAR amassed on the mound is not. This way, typical one-way players are not penalized when compared with the rare Hall of Famers who generated great value as a pitcher and as a hitter, such as Babe Ruth.\nGrouping current Hall of Famers by position (using the fielding spot at which a player generated the most WAR in his career) allows for the creation of an average JAWS at each position. These averages serve as the basis for comparisons between non-Hall of Famers and those already enshrined.\nTo prevent the position-specific JAWS averages from being skewed by small sample sizes (fewer than 300 players are in the Hall altogether, with several positions represented by fewer than 20 players), \"Hall of Fame average position players\" are added to the formula until the total number of players in a positional group matches that of the most-inducted position (currently right field). These players are given JAWS equal to the average among all non-pitchers in the Hall of Fame.\nFor example, the Hall of Fame had just 13 third basemen prior to Chipper Jones' election in 2018, compared to 24 right fielders. Accordingly, the positional group used to generate the average JAWS (55.2) among Hall of Fame third basemen included those 13 hot-corner men and 11 \"Hall of Fame average position players.\" Jones himself amassed 85 WAR in his career and 46.6 during his seven most productive seasons, based on WAR. Thus, his JAWS is 65.8."

Still, the knuckle-curve produces the desired effect of the two pitches -- a slow, curveball break mixed with some of the unpredictable fluttering of the knuckleball.\nFor those pitchers who have mastered it, the knuckle-curve is a deceptive weapon, often stashed away until they think a hitter will be fooled by it."

(They are also among the hardest pitches for catchers to catch and for umpires to call.)\nThe obvious downside to the knuckleball is that if it isn't \"dancing\" -- or moving -- it becomes very easy to hit because of the slow speed of the pitch.

    "definition": "The Lisfranc joint complex, named for the French surgeon who first described it in the 1800s, includes the five metatarsal bones along with the tendons and ligaments that connect the mid-foot to the forefoot and form the arch at the top of the foot. Ligaments and tendons in this area can be sprained, and the bones can be fractured. Lisfranc injuries can be the result of a trauma, such as a collision, or they can be caused indirectly by a sudden rotational force in the mid-foot."

    "definition": "A pitcher receives a loss when a run that is charged to him proves to be the go-ahead run in the game, giving the opposing team a lead it never gives up. Losses are almost always paired with wins when used to evaluate a pitcher, creating a separate pitching term known as win-loss record.\nWin-loss record took on a greater importance in the past for a different reason. In the time when pitchers routinely pitched complete games, bullpens were rarely at fault for losses. But today's specialization of relief pitchers has led to starters pitching fewer innings.\nA starting pitcher does not necessarily receive a loss every time his team loses -- even if he exits the game with his team trailing. In such instances, if his team ties the game or takes the lead before eventually losing, it will be the pitcher who put the go-ahead run on base who takes the loss."

It becomes prominent every year in September as teams begin closing in on clinching.\nA team's magic number represents the combination of wins needed by that team and losses by its closest competitor to clinch a given goal. Every time a team wins, its magic number decreases by one. Similarly, every time that team's closest competitor for the division (or Wild Card) loses, the magic number also decreases by one.\nThe exact formula is: Games remaining +1 - (Losses by second place team - losses by first place team)\nIf a new second-place team emerges, the magic number adjusts to that new second place team. The second-place team (in terms of total losses) must always be used as the barometer for the first-place team's magic number."

Replay officials review all calls subject to replay review and decide whether to change the call on the field, confirm the call on the field or let stand the call on the field due to the lack of clear and convincing evidence.\nA manager may challenge as many reviewable calls within a single play as he desires using one challenge. The club retains its manager challenge if the replay official overturns any challenged call (even if he upholds other challenged calls), and loses its manager challenge if no calls are overturned. Once a club has exhausted its available manager challenge(s), it will no longer have the ability to challenge any additional play or call in the game.\nManagers must hold their hands up immediately after a play to signal to the umpires that they are considering a challenge. Once the manager alerts the umpire to a potential challenge, the umpire will initiate a 15-second timer. The manager must then decide whether to challenge the call on the field before that timer reaches zero. Otherwise, any challenge request would be denied.\nBoth managers may challenge different reviewable calls within the same reviewable play, and the replay official shall review the challenged calls in the order in which the calls occurred during the game. If the decision of the replay official on an earlier reviewable call renders moot a later reviewable call, the subsequent call shall not be reviewed and that club shall not be charged with the challenge.\nThe manager must ensure that the umpire knows the specific calls for which he is seeking replay review, but the manager need not state the reason for his belief that the call was incorrect. Moreover, the replay official shall have no authority to review any calls other than those included in a manager's challenge or those accepted for review by the crew chief."

Once an optioned player has spent at least 20 days in the Minors in a given season, he loses one of his options. Only one Minor League option is used per season, regardless of how many times a player is optioned to and from the Minors over the course of a given season. (Players may only be optioned five times per season; after that, it requires outright assignment waivers to assign the player to the Minor Leagues.)\nOut-of-options players must be designated for assignment -- which removes them from the 40-man roster -- and passed through outright waivers before being eligible to be sent to the Minors.\nPlayers typically have three option years, but those who have accrued less than five full seasons (including both the Major and Minors) are eligible for a fourth if their three options have been exhausted already. For the purposes of this rule, spending at least 90 days on an active Major League or Minor League roster during a given season counts as one full season. Players also earn a full season if they spend at least 30 days on an active Major League or Minor League roster AND their active-roster and injured-list time amounts to at least 90 days in a given season.\nUpon being optioned to the Minor Leagues, a position player must remain there for a minimum of 10 days before he is eligible to be recalled to the Major League roster. For pitchers, the minimum is 15 days. If a player is serving as the 27th man for a doubleheader or replacing a player who has been placed on the injured list, there is no minimum number of days for which the optioned player must remain in the Minors.\nA player's option years do not need to be used in succession. Any player with fewer than five years of Major League service time and an option year remaining can be optioned to the Minor Leagues.

The mound visit is considered to be concluded once the manager or coach leaves the 18-foot circle surrounding the pitching rubber, though they are permitted to temporarily leave that area to notify the umpire of a substitution. In that case, the manager or coach can then return to the mound without it being counted as two mound visits.\nMound visits are limited to four per team per nine innings, though an extra mound visit is awarded for the ninth inning if the defensive team has zero remaining visits at the end of the eighth. Teams also receive an additional visit for every extra inning played.\nAny manager, coach or player visit to the mound counts as a mound visit under this rule, though visits to the mound to clean cleats in rainy weather, to check on a potential injury or after the announcement of an offensive substitution are excepted. Normal communication between a player and pitcher that doesn't require either to vacate his position on the field doesn't count as a visit.

The maneuver had been permitted for safety purposes, as it allowed the pivot man to get out of the way of the oncoming baserunner as quickly as possible.\nBut via a rule change instituted before the 2016 season, the neighborhood play is now reviewable by instant replay. That means middle infielders must touch the second-base bag while in possession of the ball in order to ensure the out is made on a ground-ball double play.

In other instances, teams will concede to a full no-trade clause that allows the player in question to block a trade to all 29 other teams.\nBeyond that, a player that has accumulated 10 years of Major League service time and has spent the past five consecutive seasons of that service time with one team gains the right -- termed 10-and-5 rights -- to veto a trade to any team."

    "definition": "Outs Above Average (OAA) is a range-based metric of skill that shows how many outs a player has saved. Prior to 2020, OAA was an outfield-only metric. But it has been expanded to include infielders. OAA is calculated differently for outfielders and infielders (details below).\nOutfielders\nOuts Above Average for outfielders starts with Catch Probability, which takes the distance an outfielder must go, the time he has to get there, and the direction he travels to put a percentage of catch likelihood on each individual batted ball. OAA for outfielders is the season-long cumulative expression of each individual Catch Probability play. For example, if an outfielder has a ball hit to him with a 75 percent Catch Probability -- that is, one an average outfielder would make three-quarters of the time -- and he catches it, he'll receive a +.25 credit. If he misses it, he'll receive -.75, reflecting the likelihood of that ball being caught by other outfielders.\nAdding up credit for every play made or not made contributes to a seasonal Outs Above Average number. In 2019, Victor Robles led MLB outfielders with +23 OAA.\nIn addition, the leaderboards show columns for \"Expected Catch Percentage,\" \"Actual Catch Percentage,\" and \"Catch Percentage Added,\" providing the ability to see how a player has performed on a rate basis.\n• Expected Catch Percentage shows how many plays an average outfielder would be expected to come up with based on the difficulty of the batted balls hit to the outfielder in question. Of the outfielders with at least 150 chances in 2017, Mike Trout's Expected Catch Percentage of 89 was the highest, meaning an average outfielder catches 89 percent of the balls Trout saw. This shows he got the least challenging opportunities sent his way, while Norichika Aoki, at 77 percent, got the toughest.\n• Actual Catch Percentage shows the production of the actual fielder on the balls hit his way. Given the difficulty of batted balls, Trout would be expected to make the catch 89 percent of the time, but in actuality, he made the catch 88 percent of the time.\n• Catch Percentage Added shows the difference between the Expected and Actual numbers. For example, Heyward and Ben Gamel were each given the same difficulty of opportunities, being expected to catch 86 percent. But with an Actual Catch Percentage of 90, Heyward added four points of value. Meanwhile, Gamel's Actual Catch Percentage was 83, so he subtracted three points of value. Heyward was seven points more valuable on a rate basis than Gamel, and +18 (comparing his +10 to Gamel's -8) Outs Above Average on a cumulative basis.\nInfielders\nOuts Above Average for infielders takes the following factors into account.\n• How far the fielder has to go to reach the ball (\"the intercept point\").• How much time he has to get there.• How far he then is from the base the runner is heading to.• On force plays, how fast the batter is, on average. (A runner's average Sprint Speed is used in the calculation, rather than his Sprint Speed on that particular play. For new players with no data, a league-average -- 27 ft/sec -- score is used; once the player qualifies for the leaderboard, all of his previous plays are re-run.)\nThe Statcast technology allows us to know exactly where each fielder stands, which is helpful in a baseball world where shifting and out-of-position defenders are commonplace. What that means is that every tracked play is accounted for, regardless of if the third baseman is standing in his regular spot, at shortstop or in short right field. It allows you to know exactly \"how far\" and \"how much time,\" regardless of shifts. It also allows for an OAA breakdown by fielder role.\nFor example, Nolan Arenado was +17 OAA in 2019, all coming as a third baseman, because he played every single inning of his season at third base. But that doesn't mean he was always standing at third base. Due to shifting, Arenado's +17 actually breaks down into +14 OAA where third basemen typically play, and +3 OAA where shortstops play.\nJavier Baez led all infielders with +19 OAA in 2019. His breakdown: +17 where shortstops typically play, and +2 where second basemen play, even though he technically was never listed on the lineup card as a second baseman in 2019."

    "definition": "A number of changes have been implemented to improve the pace of play since the 2014 season.\nIn 2015, timers were installed in Major League stadiums to measure the break time between innings and pitching changes. MLB lowered the time between innings to 2 minutes for local broadcasts and nationally televised games in 2019. MLB had instituted times of 2 minutes, 5 seconds for local broadcasts and 2 minutes, 25 seconds for nationally televised games in 2016, decreasing these times by 20 seconds from where they were previously. Prior to the 2018 season, MLB established a separate time of 2 minutes, 55 seconds for postseason games.\nAs of 2018, the umpire's signal for the final warmup pitch comes at the 25-second mark and the pitcher must throw it before the clock hits 20. The batter will be announced at the 20-second mark and the pitcher must begin his windup to throw the first pitch of the inning within the five seconds before the clock hits zero. The pitcher can take as many warmup pitches as he wants within these countdown parameters.\nFor between-innings breaks, the timer begins when the final out of the inning is recorded, with several exceptions. If the pitcher is on base, on deck or at bat when the inning ends, the timer begins when the pitcher leaves the dugout for the mound. If the catcher is on base, on deck or at bat when the inning ends, the timer begins when the catcher enters the dugout (another catcher can begin warming up the pitcher). If the final out of the inning is subject to replay, the timer begins when the umpire signals the out. And for any extended between-innings event previously approved by the Office of the Commissioner (such as the playing of \"God Bless America\"), the timer begins at the conclusion of the event.\nThe timing clock also applies to pitching changes and begins as soon as the relief pitcher crosses the warning track (or the foul line for on-field bullpens). Players can be excused from these time limits if a delay in normal warmup activities occurs due to no fault of the players, or the umpire believes a player would be at legitimate risk of injury without receiving additional time.\nIn 2016, MLB began limiting mound visits -- which previously had no limit -- to 30 seconds starting when the manager or coach has exited the dugout and been granted time by the umpire. A rule limiting the number of mound visits was first established in 2018.\nAs of 2024, clubs are limited to four mound visits per team per nine innings, though an extra mound visit is awarded for the ninth inning if the defensive team has zero remaining visits at the end of the eighth. Teams also receive an additional visit for every extra inning played. Any manager, coach or player visit to the mound counts as a mound visit, though visits to the mound to clean cleats in rainy weather, to check on a potential injury or after the announcement of an offensive substitution are excepted. Normal communication between a player and pitcher that doesn't require either to vacate his position on the field doesn't count as a visit. If a team is out of visits, the umpire will have discretion to grant a brief visit at the catcher's request if a cross-up has occurred between the pitcher and catcher.\nIn September 2022, Major League Baseball announced three rule changes that were approved by the league’s Competition Committee. The rules were adopted after extensive testing at the Minor League level over a several-year period and with feedback from MLB player and umpire representatives. In an effort to create a quicker pace of play, a 30-second timer between batters was implemented in 2023. A timer was also implemented between pitches -- 15 seconds with the bases empty and 20 seconds with runners on. The timer was reduced to 18 seconds with runners on base starting in 2024."

    "definition": "The American Association, Atlantic League, Frontier League and Pioneer League are professional baseball leagues that have been designated as Partner Leagues of Major League Baseball.\nThese leagues collaborate with MLB on various initiatives while providing organized baseball to communities throughout the United States and Canada, and also expanding the geographic reach of the game. The leagues provide development opportunities for young players throughout the country and for veteran players who seek a second chance to reach the Major Leagues. Partner Leagues also provide formal, MLB-sponsored programs to give people with diverse backgrounds additional playing and coaching opportunities.\nThe American Association consists of 12 member clubs situated in the Midwest and covering nine states (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin) and one Canadian province (Manitoba). Formed in 2006, the American Association offers fans of the league its owned and operated video streaming service, which carries all games in the league’s 600-game schedule. American Association games can also be watched coast to coast on various OTA, OTT and Linear channels. In addition to vying annually for the Miles Wolff Cup championship trophy, the league champion also qualifies for the World Baseball Softball Confederation Champions League tournament. The American Association plays a 100-game regular season from May through Labor Day. For more information, visit www.aabaseball.com.\nThe Atlantic League has been a leader in baseball innovation and has sent over 1,400 players to MLB organizations. In 2019, MLB and the Atlantic League entered a partnership to experiment with new rules and equipment. The partnership allowed MLB to explore pace of play and other initiatives, additional uses of the pitch clock, a three-batter minimum for pitchers, the restriction of infield shifts on hitters, automated balls and strikes, 18” bases, and other initiatives that have reimagined Baseball and impacted the Major Leagues. The 10-team league competes in a 126-game schedule from late April through mid-September and spans across six states including Kentucky, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. For more information, visit www.AtlanticLeague.com.\nThe Frontier League is the largest Partner League, consisting of 16 teams that stretch across eight U.S. states including Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and two Canadian provinces (Ontario and Quebec). Formed in 1993, the Frontier League added five clubs from the former Can-Am League following the 2019 season and remain one of two Partner Leagues with international connections. The Frontier League has placed more than 1,000 players in Major League organizations, with over half of those players getting their first start in pro ball in the Frontier League. In 2021, the Frontier League began play as a Partner League of MLB. The 96-game season takes place from May through September. For more information, visit www.frontierleague.com.\nSince 1939, the Pioneer Baseball League had operated in the Mountain West region as an MLB-affiliated league. Beginning in 2021, the Pioneer League became a Partner League with clubs in Montana, Idaho, Utah, Colorado and California. The Pioneer League is a player development league, with players having less than three years of professional experience. The PBL is focused on innovation and experimental rules, having initiated the shootout style “Knockout Round” to replace extra innings, designated pinch hitters and pinch runners, and other cutting-edge rules. The PBL has a 96-game slate from mid-May through mid-September. For more information, visit www.pioneerleague.com."

    "definition": "A catcher is given a passed ball if he cannot hold onto a pitch that -- in the official scorer's judgment -- he should have, and as a result at least one runner moves up on the bases. Passed balls have commonality with wild pitches, as both allow a runner to advance on his own without a stolen base. However, there is a key difference: A passed ball is deemed to be the catcher's fault, while a wild pitch is deemed to be the fault of the pitcher.\nA passed ball is not recorded as an error, but when a run scores as the result of a passed ball, it does not count as an earned run against a pitcher. (In cases where this is in question, the official scorer must reconstruct the inning, and if the run would not have scored without the passed ball, that run is deemed unearned.) If a runner advances on a passed ball, he is not credited with a stolen base.\nAfter a strikeout, if the catcher fails to catch the third strike, and the batter reaches first base safely as a result, either a passed ball or a wild pitch must be awarded. In the instance of a wild pitch, that baserunner could count against a pitcher's ERA, but in the instance of a passed ball, he cannot."

    "definition": "Perceived Velocity is an attempt to quantify how fast a pitch appears to a hitter, by factoring the Velocity of the pitch and the release point of the pitcher. It takes Velocity one step further -- because a 95 mph fastball will reach a hitter faster if the pitcher releases the ball seven feet in front of the rubber instead of six.\nTo attain Perceived Velocity, the average Major League \"Extension\" must first be obtained. Any pitcher who releases the ball from behind the average Extension will have a lower Perceived Velocity than actual Velocity. On the other hand, if a pitcher releases the ball from in front of the average Extension, he'll have a higher Perceived Velocity than actual Velocity.\nPerceived Velocity can be a good way to assess pitchers who seem to be sneakily good against hitters. A pitcher throwing a fastball at 93 mph generally shouldn't be blowing hitters away, but if that fastball has a Perceived Velocity of 96, then it makes more sense why hitters might be late on it.\nOf course, there is much more to pitching than Velocity and Perceived Velocity. And -- with offspeed pitches especially -- Perceived Velocity isn't always an indicator of a pitcher's success.\nAs you'd expect, taller pitchers with longer wingspans tend to have higher Perceived Velocities, because their release points tend to be much closer to home plate."

An illegal pickoff attempt results in a balk.\nWhen a pitcher throws to a base between pitches in an attempt to get an out or keep a runner close to the base, it's known as a pickoff attempt. Pickoff attempts are generally used to keep baserunners close to the bag, so they don't get a big lead before attempting to steal a base. Most pickoff attempts do not reach the fielder in time for him to tag out the runner, but certain pitchers possess better pickoff moves than others.\nLeft-handers, for instance, are generally much better at picking off runners than righties, because most pickoff attempts occur at first base. Lefties are facing first base before they pitch and can simply throw over, while right-handers must step off the pitching rubber and pivot before they throw. However, some right-handers have mastered the art of picking up their foot while spinning toward first.\nA team will sometimes use a pickoff move as a stall tactic to get another pitcher in the bullpen warmed up. Or, a team can also use a pickoff move to see if the hitter tips his hand as to whether he intends to bunt."

    "definition": "The movement of a pitch is defined in inches, both in raw numbers and (more importantly) as a measurement against average. It is displayed separately for horizontal break and vertical drop.\nAs opposed to other available pitch movement numbers that remove gravity, Statcast's pitch movement numbers are displayed with gravity, in an attempt to better align with the real-world eye test, as pitches are of course affected by gravity.\nSince gravity requires time, and slower pitches aren't \"better\" just because they have more time to move, the movement of a pitch is compared to \"average\" movement, by comparing it to other MLB pitch types thrown within +/- 2 mph of velocity and +/- 0.5 feet of extension and release point.\nFor example, look at the 2021 curveball drop leaders, with a minimum of 250 thrown. Dylan Cease got 61.7 inches of drop overall, less than Adam Wainwright, whose curve had 66.5 inches of drop. However, Cease generated +8.6 inches of drop more than average, while Wainwright generated +3.0 inches of drop vs. average. In other words, Cease created more drop vs. comparable curveballs.\nThat difference between \"total drop\" and \"drop vs. average\" occurred because Wainwright threw his curveball over 6 mph slower than Cease. Cease's curveball averaged 79.9 mph, while Wainwright's averaged 73.4 mph, giving it more time to drop. On the other hand, Cease's high-spin curve (he averaged 2,754 rpm in 2021) creates sharp vertical break. Measured against the comparable curveballs to theirs, Cease had better drop vs. average than Wainwright. \nStatcast's Pitch Movement leaderboard on Baseball Savant displays pitch movement data for each distinct pitch type going back to the 2017 season.\nFor breaking balls, offspeed pitches and sinkers, more vertical movement vs. average means more the pitch is generating more \"drop.\" However, for four-seam fastballs, better vertical movement vs. average means the pitch is generating more \"rise.\"\nFastballs do not physically rise on their way to the plate, but a \"rising fastball\" is one that drops less than the hitter would expect, generally due to being thrown with high spin rate and true backspin. A four-seam fastball with rise is more likely to generate swings-and-misses. Therefore, four-seam fastballs on the Pitch Movement leaderboard are ranked according to their rise vs. average."

Two tempo stats are calculated for every pitcher: the pitcher's tempo with the bases empty, and his tempo with runners on base.\nTo provide added context to a pitcher's tempo, any pitch thrown within 15 seconds is classified as \"Fast,\" and any pitch thrown after longer than 30 seconds is classified as \"Slow.\"\nIt is important to note that Statcast's pitch tempo metric is NOT the same as the MLB pitch timer that was instituted in 2023."

Overall skill helps, too, because a manager is obviously more inclined to leave a pitcher in the game longer if he trusts that pitcher to get outs. Young pitchers are generally watched by their clubs, so as to keep their pitch counts down and limit the stress on their arms. The same goes for pitchers who may be prone to arm injuries.\nIt's important for each team to have at least a couple pitchers with high pitches per start averages, as those pitchers help limit the tax on their teams' bullpens. However, because pitches per start doesn't tell us much about a pitcher's success, it isn't the best way to evaluate how likely a pitcher is to go deep into a ballgame."

This rule is in place because not every plate appearance results in an at-bat, and some hitters -- those who walk and are hit by pitches more frequently -- might not qualify for certain statistical leaderboards if only their at-bats were considered.\nThe total plate appearances for a team in a game should equal its runs, men left on base and men put out. A batter does not receive a plate appearance if a runner is thrown out on the bases to end the inning while he is at bat, or if the game-winning run scores on a balk, wild pitch or passed ball while he is at bat."

Pop Time is a much better assessment of a catcher's ability to throw out baserunners than the strength of his arm alone. A catcher with a great arm isn't going to throw out many baserunners if it takes him a while to transfer the ball to his throwing hand and then release the throw.\nA catcher with a good Pop Time doesn't always throw out baserunners, however. A large part of his success is dependent upon the runner's speed, the throw's accuracy and the pitcher's delivery length.

The concept strives to determine the number of games that a team *should* have won -- based its total number of runs scored versus its number of runs allowed -- in an effort to better forecast that team's future outlook.\nThe initial formula for pythagorean winning percentage was as follows: (runs scored ^ 2) / [(runs scored ^ 2) + (runs allowed ^ 2)] That formula proved more predictive than basic winning percentage when trying to predict a team's future performance, although in the years since pythagorean winning percentage was popularized, other analysts have attempted to find an even more accurate formula.\nBaseball-Reference.com, for instance, uses 1.83 as its exponent of choice -- a modification that has successfully narrowed the formula's margin of error."

    "url": "/glossary/transactions/qualifying-offer",
    "definition": "The qualifying offer is a competitive balance measure that was implemented as part of the 2012-16 Collective Bargaining Agreement and restructured under the 2017-21 Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n(Under the terms of the 2022-26 Collective Bargaining Agreement, MLB and the MLB Players Association had the opportunity to agree on the implementation of an International Draft by July 25, 2022, which would have eliminated the qualifying offer system starting with the 2022-23 offseason. The two sides did not agree by the deadline, though, meaning the system will remain in place until the end of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement.)\nIn the qualifying offer system, clubs wishing to receive compensatory Draft picks for the loss of a free agent can make a one-year “qualifying offer,” worth the mean salary of MLB’s 125 highest-paid players, to their impending free agents prior to the onset of free agency if and only if:\n1. That player has never received a qualifying offer previously in his career.\n2. That player spent the entire season on that team’s roster (in-season acquisitions are ineligible).\nA player can accept or decline the qualifying offer, during which time he can negotiate with other teams to survey his market value. Should a player decide to accept the qualifying offer, he is signed for the following year at that predetermined rate (i.e., the mean salary of the league’s 125 highest-paid players). If a player rejects the qualifying offer, he is free to further explore the free-agent market.\nNote: Teams became subject to the above parameters beginning between the 2017 and 2018 seasons.\nCompensation for losing players who reject their QO\nIf a team gives a qualifying offer to a player who then signs elsewhere, the club that lost the player is eligible for Draft pick compensation in the next year’s MLB Draft.\n• Competitive Balance Tax payors: If the team that loses the player went over the CBT threshold, the compensation pick will be placed after the fourth round has been completed. The value of the player’s contract doesn’t matter in this case.\n• Revenue-sharing recipients: If the team that loses the player is a revenue-sharing recipient, based on its revenues and market size, then the selection – if and only if the lost player signs for at least $50 million – will be awarded a pick between the first round and Competitive Balance Round A. If the player signs for less than $50 million, the compensation pick for those teams would come after Competitive Balance Round B, which follows the second round.\n• All other teams: If the team that loses the player does not receive revenue sharing and did not exceed the CBT salary threshold the previous season, its compensatory pick will come after Competitive Balance Round B. The value of the player’s contract doesn’t matter in this case.\nLike standard Draft picks, compensatory picks in a given tier are ordered in accordance with the previous season’s standings. If a team with MLB’s worst record and a team with a .500 record both lose a free agent that signs for more than $50 million, the team with the worse record would receive the higher of the two compensatory picks.\nPenalties for signing players who reject their QO\nAny team that signs a player who has rejected a qualifying offer is subject to the loss of one or more Draft picks. However, a team’s highest first-round pick is exempt from forfeiture. (Players who are unsigned after the start of the MLB Draft in the year that follows the rejection of their qualifying offer are no longer tied to Draft pick compensation and can be signed without their new club needing to forfeit a Draft pick.)\nThree tiers of Draft pick forfeiture – based on the financial status of the signing team – are in place to serve as a penalty for signing a player who rejected a qualifying offer:\n• Competitive Balance Tax payors: A team that exceeded the CBT threshold in the preceding season will lose its second- and fifth-highest selections in the following year’s Draft, as well as $1 million from its international bonus pool for the upcoming signing period. If such a team signs multiple qualifying-offer free agents, it will forfeit its third- and sixth-highest picks as well.\n• Revenue-sharing recipients: A team that receives revenue-sharing money will lose its third-highest selection in the following year’s Draft. If it signs two such players, it will also forfeit its fourth-highest pick.\n• All other teams: If a team does not receive revenue sharing and did not exceed the CBT salary threshold in the previous season, it will lose its second-highest selection in the following year’s Draft, as well as $500,000 from its international bonus pool for the upcoming signing period. If one of these teams signs two such players, it will also forfeit its third-highest pick.\n(Note: Each pick in the first 10 rounds of the Draft has an assigned value, and the total for each of a club’s selections equals what it can spend on signing bonuses for players selected in those rounds without incurring a penalty. When a team forfeits a Draft pick, it also surrenders the accompanying bonus pool money associated that pick, independent from any money forfeited from its international bonus pool per the rules below.)\nHistory of the rule\nUnder the 2012-16 Collective Bargaining Agreement, a club that signed a player who rejected a qualifying offer had to surrender its best unprotected pick – any pick that didn’t fall in the top 10 – in the subsequent MLB Draft. If the club’s best pick fell in the top 10, it had to surrender its next-best pick instead. If a club signed more than one player that rejected a qualifying offer, it had to surrender its best and second-best unprotected picks.\nFree-agent compensation picks were awarded after the natural first round of the Draft and before Competitive Balance Round A."

With ground-ball pitchers on the mound, for example, an infielder is bound to receive more opportunities to boost his Range Factor. The advent of defensive shifts has affected Range Factor further. For instance, a third baseman who is used frequently in shifts will likely have a higher Range Factor than one who isn't -- even though defensive positioning is generally determined by the manager or bench coach.\nStill, Range Factor answers a pivotal question that went long unanswered when fielding percentage was used as the primary evaluative defensive metric: How many plays can a given fielder make? Or, put more simply, how much range does a fielder have?"

If the home team is leading after the visiting team has made three outs in the top of the ninth inning, the home team wins and does not have to come to bat in the bottom of the ninth.\nIf the game is tied after both teams have made 27 outs each, the game will go to extra innings.

First, if a reliever is in the game at the time his team takes the lead for good, he is credited with the victory. A reliever can also pick up the win if the starting pitcher pitches fewer than five innings in what would have been the starter's win, and the official scorer deems that reliever to have been the \"most effective\" in preserving the win.\nRelief victories are inevitably a product of circumstance; they come down to when a pitcher enters the game. Often times, a reliever will allow the tying or go-ahead run to score before his team takes the lead for good in the next half inning. In this case, the reliever didn't do his job very well, but he picks up the win anyway.\nIn a rarely used clause, an official scorer can deem a relief pitcher's appearance \"brief and ineffective.\" (For example, if a reliever relinquished a one-run lead by allowing three runs, but was still in line for a win after his team scored four runs in the following inning -- that may qualify.) In such cases, the scorer can award the win to a pitcher who followed that \"brief and ineffective\" pitcher. The pitcher who receives that win is also determined by the official scorer."

If a player enters the game as a pinch-runner and scores, he is also credited with a run.\nThe league leaders in runs scored are generally adept at reaching safely and running the bases. But they also tend to score frequently because of favorable positions toward the top their teams' lineups -- a factor that has little to do with the run-scorer's own abilities.\nWith almost no exception, a pitcher is charged with having allowed a run if a runner he allows to reach base comes around to score. This is different from earned runs, which are not applied if the pitcher allows runs due to defensive errors by his team.\nOn rare occasions, a pitcher can be charged with a run even when he did not directly allow the scoring player to reach base. If a pitcher allows a baserunner before exiting, and the following pitcher gets a fielder's choice out, the original pitcher is still responsible for the batter who just reached base.

In National League parks, a pitcher can help his cause as a hitter.) Instead, RS/9 is way of adding context to a pitcher's win-loss record. Does a given pitcher's winning percentage seem a bit too high or a bit too low given his other stats? RS/9 is often the culprit.\nIt's important to note that for this metric, run support constitutes only the runs that are scored for a pitcher while he is in the game. A few other run-support metrics will take into account how many runs a team scores for its starting pitcher over the course of an entire game. In that vein, RS/9 also works for relief pitchers (although those numbers should be taken with a grain of salt, because relievers have such small sample sizes in terms of innings pitched)."

Typically, a player will be given a sign by the third-base coach, instructing a bunt attempt. In National League ballparks, pitchers are frequently called upon to sacrifice bunt.\nIf an error is committed and the batter reaches base, he is still credited with a sacrifice. However, if the sacrifice bunt attempt turns into a single, the batter is simply credited with a hit and no sacrifice is given.

Players and clubs negotiate over salaries, primarily based on comparable players who have signed contracts in recent seasons. A player's salary can indeed be reduced in arbitration -- with 20 percent being the maximum amount by which a salary can be cut.\nIf the club and player have not agreed on a salary by a deadline (typically in mid-January), the club and player must exchange salary figures for the upcoming season. After the figures are exchanged, a hearing is scheduled (typically in February). If no one-year or multi-year settlement can be reached by the hearing date, the case is brought before a panel of arbitrators. After hearing arguments from both sides, the panel selects either the salary figure of either the player or the club (but not one in between) as the player's salary for the upcoming season.\nThe week prior to the exchange of arbitration figures is when the vast majority of arbitration cases are avoided, either by agreeing to a one- or multi-year contract.

Obviously, then, save percentage is calculated by dividing a pitcher's total number of saves by his total number of save opportunities.\nSave percentage can be a useful tool for evaluating pitchers who are strictly closers. Ranking pitchers by total saves isn't effective because saves are so reliant on outside factors that a closer can't control -- such as how often a closer's team has a lead in the eighth or ninth innings. But save percentage levels the playing field between closers who get many save opportunities and closers who don't. It simply answers the question: How successful is a closer at getting a save when he has a chance?\nIf a reliever records a hold, it does not affect his save percentage, because he has not been credited with either a save or a blown save."

    "definition": "Players receive Major League service time for each day spent on the 26-man roster or the Major League injured list. Important to players and clubs alike, service time is used to determine when players are eligible for arbitration as well as free agency.\nEach Major League regular season consists of 187 days (typically 183 days prior to 2018), and each day spent on the active roster or injured list earns a player one day of service time. (Any player who violates MLB's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program doesn't receive Major League Service during his suspension, unless his suspension is reduced by 20 or more games under the mitigation provision of the program.)\nA player is deemed to have reached \"one year\" of Major League service upon accruing 172 days in a given year. Upon reaching six years of Major League service, a player becomes eligible for free agency at the end of that season (unless he has already signed a contract extension that covers one or more of his free-agent seasons).\nAll players with at least three (but less than six) years of Major League service time become eligible for salary arbitration, through which they can earn substantial raises relative to the Major League minimum salary. Additionally, Major League Baseball each year identifies the group of players that ended the prior season with between two and three years of Major League service and at least 86 days of Major League service in that season and designates the top 22 percent -- in terms of service time -- as arbitration eligible. Those in the top 22 percent -- \"Super Two\" players -- are also eligible for salary arbitration despite having less than three years of Major League service. The 2022-26 collective bargaining agreement established a $50 million bonus pool for pre-arbitration players.\nService time also becomes a factor for players who are considerably further along in their careers. Players with at least 10 years of Major League service who have spent the past five consecutive seasons with the same team earn \"10-and-5\" rights. Under these circumstances, a player can veto any trade scenario that is proposed. In essence, 10-and-5 rights function as a full no-trade clause."

    "definition": "Pitchers are permitted to use two legal pitching deliveries -- the windup position and the set position -- and either position may be used at any time.\nA pitcher is considered to be in the set position when he puts his pivot foot against the pitching rubber, has both shoulders facing first (for lefty pitchers) or third (for righty pitchers) base to some degree and holds the ball with both hands in front of his body. As a result of this configuration, a pitcher in the set position points his glove-hand shoulder toward the batter and his throwing shoulder toward center field. When delivering the ball from the set position, a pitcher simply lifts his free leg up, pushes off the rubber with his pivot foot, strides toward the batter and delivers the pitch to the catcher.\nThe set position is often used with runners on base, as the length of time needed to complete the delivery is much shorter than the windup position. Thus, pitchers are better able to prevent runners from stealing bases from the set position. To shorten their deliveries further when pitching from the set position, some pitchers use a \"slide step\" to stride toward the batter rather than first using a full leg kick. Because relievers often enter the game with runners already on base, many pitch from the set position exclusively -- even when the bases are empty."

By definition, any pitcher who throws a shutout is also awarded a win. Because he recorded every out for his team and didn't allow a run, his team could only have won.\nIf a starting pitcher does not allow a run but is removed before the game ends, he is not given credit for a shutout. However, if the ensuing reliever(s) also do not allow a run, the team as a whole is credited with a shutout.\nIn very rare instances, a pitcher can pitch a shutout if he enters in relief. Per official MLB rule 9.18: \"No pitcher shall be credited with pitching a shutout unless he pitches the complete game, or unless he enters the game with none out before the opposing team has scored in the first inning, puts out the side without a run scoring and pitches the rest of the game without allowing a run.\" The latter represents the only circumstance in which a pitcher is credited with a shutout but not a complete game.\nIn order to complete a shutout, a pitcher must remain in the game for every out. Even if a pitcher throws nine shutout innings, he is not credited with a shutout if the game goes into extra innings. If a game is shortened by rain, a pitcher is still credited with a shutout if he allows no runs and pitches the entire contest."

And if a batter hits a rocket to the outfield wall but is held at first base -- it's also a single. (A batter is still credited with a single if he reaches first safely but is thrown out while trying to advance to second.)\nThe league's leaders in singles are typically speedy contact hitters who bat higher in the batting order. However, the leaderboard for singles isn't as commonly referenced as the leaderboards for home runs, doubles or triples.\nEven though the batter only reaches first base, many singles allow runners to advance two bases.

The sinker is one of the most frequently thrown pitches in baseball, although its popularity has decreased in recent seasons. Sinkerballers are adept at limiting home runs.\nA sinker is often a few ticks slower than a four-seam fastball, but it tends to have more movement. It drops more than a four-seam fastball -- hence the sinker name -- and is more likely to force grounders, where a four-seamer is more likely to generate swings and misses. Sinkers are often thrown with lower spin and lower in the strike zone than a four-seamer in an effort to keep the ball on the ground.\nIn addition to its vertical movement, a sinker moves in the same direction as whichever arm is being used to throw it (meaning a right-handed pitcher's sinker will break horizontally toward a right-handed hitter or away from a left-handed hitter). A sinker's horizontal movement might be described as \"tail\" or \"arm-side run.\""

(When a pitch seems to toe the line between the two, it is referred to in slang as a \"slurve.\")\nMost professional pitchers possess either a slider or a curveball -- and some possess both breaking pitches. Having a breaking pitch, like a slider, is an essential component to a professional starter's arsenal, because it keeps the hitter a bit off-balance and unable to commit to gearing up exclusively for a fastball.\nA slider is meant to be slightly more deceptive than a curveball because it is thrown harder and has spin that more closely resembles a fastball -- although it doesn't create as much overall movement. Many power relief pitchers possess only a fastball and a slider in their arsenals -- with one pitch setting up the other because of the late deception created by the slider."

A swing that is 60% squared up, for example, tells you that the batter attained 60% of the maximum possible exit velocity available to him, again based on the speed of the swing and pitch.\nData observation has told us that it’s only possible to attain that maximum possible exit velocity when a ball hits the sweet spot of the bat, approximately 4 to 9 inches from the head of the bat. Therefore, comparing the exit velocity observed with the exit velocity theoretically possible can tell us a great deal about how well the batter squared the ball up.

    "definition": "A stolen base occurs when a baserunner advances by taking a base to which he isn't entitled. This generally occurs when a pitcher is throwing a pitch, but it can also occur while the pitcher still has the ball or is attempting a pickoff, or as the catcher is throwing the ball back to the pitcher.\nA stolen base is not automatically credited when a runner advances during one of the aforementioned scenarios; the official scorer must also determine that the runner had been in attempt of a steal. For example, if a runner takes an extra base on a wild pitch or a passed ball, he is not awarded a stolen base. However, if he was attempting to steal as a wild pitch/passed ball was thrown, he is generally given credit for it.\nA baserunner is not given credit for a steal if he takes the extra base as the result of an error by the opposing defense. He is not given credit for a steal if he safely advances but another runner also attempting to steal on the same play is thrown out. (This maneuver is called a \"double steal.\") He is also not given credit if the defense concedes the base because of the situation in the game. (This generally occurs very late in the contest, with the defensive team ahead by more than one run. The defense -- not wanting to play out of position -- doesn't cover the base and, as a result, the ruling is \"defensive indifference\" rather than a stolen base.)\nStolen bases have long been an integral part -- and one of the most debated aspects -- of the game. The upside to a stolen base is obvious; the runner advances a base and puts himself closer to scoring. However, the downside -- a baserunner making an out -- arguably far outweighs the upside. In this vein, a runner who steals bases at a 50 percent clip is considered to be doing his team a disservice. As a general rule of thumb, a base stealer with a stolen-base percentage of 75 or higher is helping his team by attempting steals.\nThere are few maneuvers in baseball more strategic than a stolen-base attempt. In some cases, the third-base coach will give the runner a sign, telling him to steal. But certain runners, who have proven to be competent base stealers, are given \"the green light,\" whereby they can take off at their discretion. One of the most common times to steal occurs with two outs and the hitter behind in the count. In this case, the downside to stealing is minimized. If the runner is thrown out, the hitter gets a fresh count to start the next inning. But if the runner is safe, he has put himself in scoring position.\nThe league leaders in stolen bases are almost always among the fastest players in the league, for obvious reasons. However, speed is only one ingredient in the stolen base. A base stealer must also be adept at choosing a good pitch to run on (generally a breaking ball, which will travel slower to the plate than a fastball and sometimes bounce in the dirt). He must also be able to read the situation and a pitcher's pickoff move to get a good first step."

As a general rule of thumb, a base stealer with an SB% of 75 or higher is typically helping his team by attempting to steal.\nOften times, players without great speed or a high number of steals can post high stolen-base percentages.

Types of substitutions include pinch-hitting, pinch-running, a pitching change and a defensive replacement.\nPitchers must either face a minimum of three batters in an appearance or pitch to the end of a half-inning, with exceptions for injuries and illnesses. If a pitcher faces one batter to end an inning, he may be removed, but if he is brought back for a second inning, he must still face two more batters for a total of three.\nA double-switch refers to the act of substituting two players at once. Before the designated-hitter rule was adopted by the National League in the 2022-26 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the tactic was typically used in NL games to bring in a new pitcher when the pitcher's spot in the batting order was due up in the next half-inning. Rather than performing a straight one-for-one swap of pitcher for pitcher, a team would sub the new pitcher into the batting-order spot of a non-pitcher and sub another non-pitcher into the removed pitcher's batting-order spot. That way, the team could avoid having the pitcher come to bat in the next half-inning without needing to use additional substitutions for a pinch-hitter and then another pitcher."

Other rarer causes for suspended games include a technical malfunction in the stadium that prevents the game from continuing.\nPrior to the 2020 season, if a regular season game was terminated early before becoming official, the results up to the point of the termination did not count and the game was started over at a later date. But as part of MLB's health and safety protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic, all games cut short before becoming official were resumed at a later date, rather than started over from scratch, during the 2020 campaign. This matched the rules that have been in place since 2008 for all postseason games and any tiebreaker games added to the end of the regular season."

The main characteristic of a sweeper is a large amount of horizontal movement, as opposed to a traditional slider, which has \"tighter\" break.\nA sweeper tends to be thrown slower than a traditional slider, which gives it more time to \"sweep\" across the strike zone. Where the average MLB slider breaks about six inches horizontally, the average sweeper breaks about 15 inches. You might hear a sweeper referred to as a \"Frisbee slider\" because of the way it moves.\nWhile a harder slider tends to rely more on deception by resembling a pitcher's fastball, a sweeper is effective because of how much it breaks across the plate. The sweeper's amount of movement makes it hard for a hitter to square up the ball, so sweepers can often produce weak contact or swings and misses."

With that information available for each play, the player’s actual success rate can be compared to the estimated rate and the cumulative metric can be created. Importantly, it does account both for bases taken (prevented, for outfielders) and chances taken or not. In that way, credit can be given to outfielders who do not get a chance to make an assist because their reputation for quality throwing precedes them.\nThis does account for extra bases taken by batters or runners on batted balls; it does not include stolen bases, as it’s about taking extra bases against fielders.\nA good example can be seen here, when Ronald Acuña Jr. threw out Alec Burleson attempting to stretch a single into a double. Based on factors including the location of the ball, the distance from second base, and knowledge of the speed and location of the runner, this was a chance where Acuña was given just a 5% estimated likelihood of throwing the runner out. That he successfully did so gave him +0.95 runs to his seasonal total.\nThe top of the 2022 seasonal leaderboard offers a good example of how different skills can lead into the seasonal total.\nMichael A. Taylor led at +6 runs, ahead of several tied at +5. Taylor’s +5 came via: +4 runs on throwing runners out, +6 runs on holds (having runners not attempt to advance), and -5 on advances (allowing runners to advance). In that way, he receives credit for more than just assists."

Taking a tendon from John's wrist, Jobe drilled holes into John's ulna and humerus bones and grafted the tendon in a basic figure-eight design, held in place by anchors. Jobe said in 2013 that he gave the procedure \"about a one in 100 chance\" of working at the time. John returned to big league action in April 1976.\nThe second Tommy John surgery wasn't done until 1978, when pitcher Brent Strom was operated on by Jobe. Tommy John surgery has become much more common in the years since then. The procedure has revolutionized the game, making it possible and even probable to return from an injury that previously was likely to end a career. As of June 2017, 86 percent of all players who had reportedly undergone Tommy John surgery had at the very least returned to the competition level they were at prior to the procedure. For example, a Triple-A pitcher who had Tommy John surgery and subsequently made it back to Triple-A or appeared in the Majors would count toward the 86 percent of successful cases."

Also, triples are more likely to occur on balls hit to the right side of the field, because the throw from right field to third base is tougher than the throw coming from left field to third.\nBecause of the nature of a triple -- with the batter covering three bases, or 270 feet -- there is almost always a close play at third base.

First off, they can occur only when the batting team has at least two men on base with nobody out. Then, in those cases, the batting team typically has to make a baserunning blunder to aid the defending team. The most common form of a triple play begins with a hard line drive at an infielder. In this instance, runners sometimes have already left their bases -- either to steal, as part of a hit and run or simply because they didn't get a good read on where the ball was headed. The defense will then throw to both bases, getting both runners out.\nStill, there is no common method for a triple play, like there is with a ground-ball double play. There have been ground-ball triple plays, typically with a slow runner batting. There have also been situations where multiple runners get caught in rundowns. Additionally, triple plays have resulted from confusion at an umpire's call.\nOne of the rarest occurrences in baseball is the unassisted triple play, where a single fielder turns a triple play without ever giving up the baseball. There are no defensive assists on the play, and thus it is unassisted. Every unassisted triple play in history (through the 2016 season) has followed a pattern, where the three outs are recorded by: 1. An infielder catching a line drive, and 2. that infielder tagging a runner and stepping on second base (in no particular order)."

Each umpire makes \"out\" or \"safe\" decisions at his designated base, and the home-plate umpire is responsible for calling balls and strikes on each pitch that is thrown. The first-base umpire determines whether batted balls were hit into fair or foul territory down the right-field line past the first-base bag, with the third-base umpire doing the same on balls hit down the left-field line beyond the third-base bag. Umpires at first and third base can also assist the home-plate umpire in determining whether a batter offered at a pitch or \"checked his swing.\" If the latter is determined, a pitch outside the strike zone is recorded as a ball.\nUmpires also have the jurisdiction to eject players, coaches or managers who break certain rules or do not display proper on-field conduct.\nUnlike the umpires stationed in the field, the home-plate umpire stands behind the plate and wears a facemask and a heavy chest pad in order to protect against batted balls that are fouled directly backward.\nDuring postseason contests, Major League Baseball adds left-field and right-field umpires to help ensure accurate calls on baseballs hit down the fair/foul lines. Umpires stationed in the outfield can also assess if a batted ball hit in their vicinity was caught on the fly or trapped in a fielder's glove after bouncing on the grass.\nMajor League Baseball also employs replay officials -- full-time Major League umpires who work shifts in the Replay Command Center in New York.

First, it's a pitcher's job to prevent runs -- not to simply prevent earned runs. Second, not every error is created equal -- and some plays that are ruled as hits can be a product of subpar defense.\nAlthough unearned runs don't hurt a pitcher's ERA, they can hurt a pitcher in other ways -- namely in his quest to win.

Because both of these factors are extremely important in the process, walks are looked at as a stat for both pitchers and hitters.\nThe game's better hitters earn a higher number of walks because pitchers tend to avoid throwing them hittable pitches, and because their keen eye allows them to lay off pitches that narrowly miss the strike zone.

As long as enough runs are scored to end the game as the result of the play, it is considered a walk-off.\nIn walk-off situations with fewer than two outs and a runner on third base, a visiting team will typically adjust its defense to maximize the chances of stopping a runner at home plate. The visitors typically bring the infield in, so the infielders are positioned closer to home plate. Sometimes, a manager will even bring one of his outfielders into the infield to maximize the chances of throwing home for an out on a ground ball. Outfielders will almost always play very shallow to have a chance at a double play on a flyout or to throw the runner out at home on a single.\nA walk-off is almost always celebrated by the home team, with its players mobbing the contributor who recorded the game-winning plate appearance. Because a walk-off can only occur in the game's final half inning, the visiting team cannot record a walk-off in any situation."

    "definition": "WHIP is one of the most commonly used statistics for evaluating a pitcher's performance. The statistic shows how well a pitcher has kept runners off the basepaths, one of his main goals. The formula is simple enough -- it's the sum of a pitcher's walks and hits, divided by his total innings pitched.\nThe pitchers with the lowest WHIPs are generally the best pitchers in the league -- which makes sense, because the best pitchers should be able to prevent baserunners. However, WHIP does not consider the way in which a hitter reached base. (Obviously, home runs are more harmful to pitchers than walks.)\nHit batsmen, errors and hitters who reach via fielder's choice do not count against a pitcher's WHIP."

    "definition": "Walks per nine innings tells us how many walks a given pitcher allows per nine innings pitched -- using the formula walks divided by innings times nine.\nObviously, a pitcher's goal is to keep opposing batters off the bases -- and a walk does just the opposite of that. If he allows a ball in play, he at least puts the outcome in the hands of his defense -- and luck. But a walk gives the team behind him no chance to help."

    "url": "/glossary/rules/warmup-pitches",
    "definition": "When taking their position at the beginning of an inning or when relieving another pitcher, pitchers are permitted to throw as many warmup pitches as they want within the countdown parameters set forth by Major League Baseball.\nThe time between innings is 2 minutes for both local broadcasts and nationally televised games in the regular season and 2 minutes, 55 seconds for postseason games. The umpire's signal for the final warmup pitch comes at the 25-second mark and the pitcher must throw it before the clock hits 20. The batter will be announced at the 20-second mark and the pitcher must begin his windup to throw the first pitch of the inning within the five seconds before the clock hits zero.\nThe timing clock also applies to pitching changes and begins as soon as the relief pitcher crosses the warning track (or the foul line for on-field bullpens). Players can be excused from these time limits if a delay in normal warmup activities occurs due to no fault of the players, or the umpire believes a player would be at legitimate risk of injury without receiving additional time.\nFor between-innings breaks, the timer begins when the final out of the inning is recorded, with several exceptions. If the pitcher is on base, on deck or at bat when the inning ends, the timer begins when the pitcher leaves the dugout for the mound. If the catcher is on base, on deck or at bat when the inning ends, the timer begins when the catcher enters the dugout (another catcher can begin warming up the pitcher). If the final out of the inning is subject to replay, the timer begins when the umpire signals the out. And for any extended between-innings event previously approved by the Office of the Commissioner (such as the playing of \"God Bless America\"), the timer begins at the conclusion of the event.\nShould a pitcher enter the game to replace one who was removed due to an injury or another emergency situation, he is granted as many warmup pitches as the umpire allows."

    "definition": "wOBA is a version of on-base percentage that accounts for how a player reached base -- instead of simply considering whether a player reached base. The value for each method of reaching base is determined by how much that event is worth in relation to projected runs scored (example: a double is worth more than a single).\nFor instance: In 2014, a home run was worth 2.101 times on base, while a walk was worth 0.69 times on base. So a player who went 1-for-4 with a home run and a walk would have a wOBA of .558 -- (2.101 + 0.69 / 5 PAs)."

But -- unlike wOBA -- wRAA is a counting stat. As a result, players with a higher number of plate appearances can accrue a higher wRAA than an equal player with fewer plate appearances."

    "definition": "A pitcher is charged with a wild pitch when his pitch is so errant that the catcher is unable to control it and, as a result, baserunner(s) advance. (This is an important stipulation. No matter how poor the pitch, a pitcher is only charged with a WP if at least one runner moves up a base, and he cannot be charged with a wild pitch if no one is on base -- unless it allows the batter to reach base on a third strike.)\nWild pitches have commonality with passed balls -- which represent the same thing, but are the fault of the catcher instead of the pitcher. The decision whether a pitch is ruled a passed ball or a wild pitch is in the hands of the official scorer. But a general rule of thumb is that if the pitch hits the dirt or misses a catcher's glove altogether, it's a wild pitch.\nCertain pitchers who struggle with their control tend to have high wild pitch totals. As a result, pitchers who allow a high number of walks often allow a higher-than-average number of wild pitches. Pitchers who possess very good curveballs -- or any other breaking ball -- also are at risk of throwing wild pitches. Sometimes the pitch is intended to bounce in the dirt, with the goal being to deceive the hitter into thinking it's crossing the strike zone at his knees before plummeting into the ground. This puts a burden on the catcher to block the baseball and prevent a wild pitch."

    "definition": "A pitcher receives a win when he is the pitcher of record when his team takes the lead for good -- with a couple rare exceptions. First, a starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings (in a traditional game of nine innings or longer) to qualify for the win. If he does not, the official scorer awards the win to the most effective relief pitcher.\nThere is also a rarely used clause where an official scorer can deem a relief pitcher's appearance \"brief and ineffective.\" (For example, if a reliever relinquished a one-run lead by allowing three runs, but was still in line for a win after his team scored four runs in the following inning -- that may qualify.) If that's the case, the scorer can award the win to a pitcher who followed that \"brief and ineffective\" pitcher. Which relief pitcher earns the win specifically is also up to the judgment of the official scorer."

    "definition": "Win Expectancy (WE), otherwise known as Win Probability, indicates the chance a team has to win a particular game at a specific point in that game.\nExpressed as a percentage, Win Expectancy is calculated by comparing the current game situation -- with the score, inning, number of outs, men on base and run environment all considered -- to similar historical situations. More specifically, the percentage is derived from the number of teams that faced a comparable situation in the past and went on to win the game.\nWin Expectancy is the basis for Win Probability Added (WPA), which quantifies the percent change in a team's chances of winning from one event to the next. For example, if a team's Win Expectancy jumps from 30 percent before a home run to 70 percent after, the player who hit the homer would have a WPA of 0.40 for increasing his team's chances of winning by 40 percent."

    "definition": "WPA quantifies the percent change in a team's chances of winning from one event to the next. It does so by measuring the importance of a given plate appearance in the context of the game. For instance: a homer in a one-run game is worth more than a homer in a blowout.\nAs an example: When Josh Donaldson came to the plate in the bottom of the ninth on May 26, 2015, the Blue Jays trailed by two and had men on second and third with no one out. That gave them a 43-percent win expectancy. After Donaldson's walk-off homer, their win expectancy jumped to 100 percent. Because Donaldson boosted the Blue Jays' chances of winning by 57 percent, his WPA for that plate appearance was 0.57.\nA player's WPA can also be affected on the basepaths. It will increase if he steals a base but decrease if he is caught stealing or picked off."

When starting his delivery from the windup position, a pitcher has the option to take a step back or to the side with his free foot. The pitcher then turns his pivot foot to be parallel to the pitching rubber, lifts his free leg up, pushes off the rubber with his pivot foot, strides toward the batter and delivers the pitch to the catcher.\nThe windup position is rarely used with runners on base, as the length of time needed to complete the windup makes pitchers more susceptible to stolen bases if using it with men on base."
