First, a starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings (in a traditional game of nine innings or longer) to qualify for the win.  If he does not, the official scorer awards the win to the most effective relief pitcher"

    "summary": "Win Expectancy (WE), otherwise known as Win Probability, indicates the chance a team has to win a particular game at a specific point in that game. Expressed as a percentage, Win Expectancy is calculated by comparing the current game situation -- with the score, inning, number of outs, men on base and run environment all considered -- to similar historical situations.  More specifically, the percentage is derived from the number of teams that faced a comparable situation in the past and went on to win the game"

A pitcher is considered to be in the windup position when he puts his pivot foot on the pitching rubber and has both shoulders facing the batter to some degree.  When starting his delivery from the windup position, a pitcher has the option to take a step back or to the side with his free foot"
